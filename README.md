# police_killings_USA

As an occupational health researcher working primarily with firefighters and police officers, I beleive it is important to try to deepy understand the occupations, and to try and put myself in their shoes in order to understand their occupations and lifestyles. 

In this dataset I analyze one of the hardest, and most controversial, parts of being a police officer, using lethal force.

My goal is to better understand these killings, why they happen, understand how they realte to media reporting, and to see if they are going up or down over time.

This data was obtained from https://mappingpoliceviolence.us/.

Mapping Police Violence is a 501(c)(3) organization that publishes the most comprehensive and up-to-date data on police violence in America to support transformative change.
